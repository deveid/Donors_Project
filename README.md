# Donors_Project
Donors receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the Donors website. 
The goal of this notebook is to predict whether or not a Donors project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, 
This notebook is aimed at prescreening and helping more teachers get funded more quickly, and with less cost to Donors, allowing them to channel even more funding directly to classrooms.
